    <h2>Top 5 Green Tips for reducing e-waste.</h2>

    <p>
        UK businesses and households produce 1.45 million tonnes of e-waste a year,
        equating to 23.9kg of e-waste each year per capita, which places the UK as
        the second highest producer in the world.

    <h3>What is e-waste?</h3>

    <p>
        Electronic waste, or e-waste, refers to any product with electrical components
        that businesses and households dispose of, including laptops, tablets, phones,
        televisions, air conditioners and printers. The proliferation of electronic
        devices among businesses and households is causing a major environmental problem
        since unwanted electronics are often sent to landfill with little consideration
        for the reusable resources they contain.
